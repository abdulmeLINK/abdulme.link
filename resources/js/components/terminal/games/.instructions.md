# Terminal Games Directory

This directory contains individual game implementations for the Terminal application.

## Structure

Each game is implemented as a separate class with the following interface:

```javascript
class GameName {
    constructor() {
        // Initialize game state
    }

    async execute(args, terminal) {
        // Start the game
        this.terminal = terminal;
        this.startGame();
    }

    // Game-specific methods...
}
```

## Performance Notes
